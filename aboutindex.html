        South Bend has an abundance of amazing,unique local restaurants that are sometimes out-shined by big chains. Our site will not only bring attention to these places, but it will also highlight why they are special. We also know how difficult it can be to find a local restaurant. Our hope is that this website will provide easy access to the restaurants that support the community.

        I've lived in South Bend for eight years.  I hope that this website will help people learn more about the local restaurants in South Bend.  I am going into 8th Grade as a homeschooler.  I did South Bend Code School to learn more about code, and I have, and now I really enjoy it.  I like to play video games and soccer.

        I have lived in South Bend all my life and love eating local, this site might help others find the same love for our local restaurants. I got into coding because I saw how much my sister enjoyed it. Now that I have done coding I enjoy it also. I am an incoming freshman at John Adams high school. I play golf and run track for Adams, but my biggest hobby is gardening.

         I enjoy coding and designing. Through code school I am learning web design and development. It is fascinating! My hobbies include: playing piano, drawing, playing outside and designing games. Life is an adventure; I canâ€™t wait to do more with html and css!

         I was born in Ohio and have lived in many places in my life. However, South Bend is my home town. I will be a Freshmen at Penn High School in the fall of 2017. My hobbies are running, gaming, and I like to pick up a good book from time to time. I really enjoy South Bend and all it has to offer and I hope this website helps others find the great places to have a great time.
